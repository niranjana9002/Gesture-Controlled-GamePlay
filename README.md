# Gesture-Controlled-GamePlay

 -----INTRODUCTION-------------
This is an app that enables the user to play any game of their choice with gestures. Minecraft and Subway 
Surfers is included and have specialised gestures. The GUI allows for customizable gestures. This project uses
OpenCV and Mediapipe, in combination with PyAutoGUI and PyDirectInput. This is the only gesture controlled app aimed
specifically for Minecraft. 


 -----REQUIREMENTS--------
1. python 3.8 or above
2. previously installed versions of Minecraft/Subway Surfers on Bluestacks
3. mediapipe
4. opencv-python 
5. pyautogui module
6. pydirectinput module
7. os module
8. threading module

---INSTALLATION-------
1. Installing opencv-python and mediapipe

pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe

2. Installing pyautogui and pydirectinput modules


pip install pyautogui
pip install pydirectinput


-----FUTURE SCOPE---------------------
	Make the app completely customizable: enable the user to add games that are already installed on the computer
and add their own gestures. Reduce the lag from the gestures to enable the user to play fast-paced multiplayer games such as PUBG.

. During the making of this project we learnt ways in which games take input, how to use landmarks on our body to provide input to the computer and
